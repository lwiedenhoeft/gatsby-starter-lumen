Thanks for reading my blog, I really appreciate it. If you would like to make a connection, please refer to the channels below.

![Contact](/media/contact.jpg)

## Twitter: larstogo
This is the fastest way if you want to reach out. Feel free to follow me there. I don't see every mention so you may not get a reply via a public tweet, but I'll try. DMs are best for initial contact.

## LinkedIn: lars-wiedenhoeft
You can find my professional background on LinkedIn. I generally accept only requests from people I've met, spoken with, worked with or had a connection with in some way. I may respond to IN messages, though.

## GitHub: lwiedenhoeft
Here you can find the source code for my tutorials, some demo projects and examples.
