Hi, my name is Lars. Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer at Siemens, where I help our developers to realize nice software products. My work interests include machine learning, monitoring, and programming in Python. In my spare time, I spend my time with history stuff, photography, basketball, and my little family.
