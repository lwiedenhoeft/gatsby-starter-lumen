Hi, I finally decided to putting something of my own up.

My plans are mainly to use this site as a way to document a few projects that I'm working on, so plan on it being pretty programming and DevOps stuff heavy- I get tired if I'm not learning something new or doing something I find challenging.

There's also a high possibility that I'll constantly be tweaking the layout of this blog - hopefully, the three people reading won't mind.
